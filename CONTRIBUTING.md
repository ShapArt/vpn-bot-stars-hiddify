# Contributing

- Use **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`...) and keep PRs small.
- Run linters/tests locally before pushing.
- For new features: open an issue first with a short pitch (use the template).

## Dev setup
See each repo `README.md` for quick start. Python repos use `uv`/`venv` or `pip` and `ruff` for linting.
